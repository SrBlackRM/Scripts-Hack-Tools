This is a basic Python Script that is useful to change Mac Address to whatever you want, so, you can bypass filters or personating other devices.<br>
The way this scripts works is very simple, you only have to call him by line command at shell with the arguments -i to set interface and -m to set what is the new mac address.
For now, only works at linux, but further I'll update to windows too.
